            This place is run by educated, innovative &creative people! The architectural layout, seating, ambience,<br>
            lighting, cutlery: servings, design; has been impeccably well thought out! Even thewashrooms were<br>
            excellent! The food was AWESOME! This is surprising consideringthe fact we were there on a Saturday night<br>
            & they almost had no space!We were extremely well serviced too! Rare to find such finesse in Kenya! You<br>
            must go visitthem!
